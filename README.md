Evaluating Classification Algorithms for Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Digital Mammography
1. The data set is included in the repository in the wdbc.data file.
2. Basic Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis is found in 1. Descriptive Statistics.
3. Feature Selection Methods are presented ni 2.0 Feature-Selection-Methods, 2.1 Random-Forest-Feature-Selection, and 2.2 Feature-Selection-Log-Reg.
4. Principal Components Analysis of the Data Set is presented in 3.0 PCA, 3.1 PCA-Log-Reg, 3.2 PCA-Random Forest, and 3.3 PCA-SVM
5. Breast Cancer Prediction using all features with K Nearest Neighbors algorithm and Support Vector Machine Algorithms is executed in 4.0 KNN and 4.1 SVM.
6. 5.0 Log-Reg-Analyze assesses the results of logistic regression for prediction of breast cancer using principal components analysis because PCA analysis yields higher accuracy than using all features or feature selection using Select K Best Features, Recursive Feature Elimination, or Recursive Elimination with Cross Validation.
